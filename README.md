# Python-Exercises
This repository contains all my studies in Python so far.

These are all Python scripts inspired by or transcribed directly from:
* the books by Al Sweigart "Python Crash Course" and "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python";
* the course 2021 Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python.
