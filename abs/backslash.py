# A backslash in Python allows a newline in any situation, even assignments
# E.g.: 
    # a = \
    # 'string assignment'
# Other situations such as print() statements or declaring lists do not
# require a backslash. E.g.:
    # print('ok' +
    # 'ok');
    # ls = [1,2,
    # 3,4]

l = [1,2,3,4,5,\
    6,7]
l1 = ['a',1,3,6\
    ,0,1000]

s = 'strin\
    g'
